- Copy [this script](https://github.com/milo526/homebridge-tuya-web/blob/master/tools/debug_discovery.py) to your PC with Python
  installed or to https://repl.it/
- Set/update config inside and run it
- Check if your devices are listed
  - If they are - open an issue and provide the output
  - If they are not - don't open an issue. Ask [Tuya support](mailto:support@tuya.com) to support your device in their 
    `/homeassistant` API
- Remove the updated script, so your credentials won't leak

Failure to follow the above steps will lead to issue closure without notice.
